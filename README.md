## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance variables both provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.  Vehicle Weight was close, but outside of the 0.05 limit.

The slope of the linear model is not zero.  Our R-squared value is 0.7149, which means tyhat over 70% of the variability of mpg is explained using this linear model.  The p-value of 5.35x10-11 is so small that it provides us sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis of the slope being zero.

This linear model effectively predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes, because of the extremely small p-value.
